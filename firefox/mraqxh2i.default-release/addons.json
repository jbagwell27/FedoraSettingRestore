It comes with advanced ways to select what links to download, and will remember your previous decisions so that you can queue more downloads with just OneClick!\n\nAdvanced users will also like using renaming masks, which let you automatically assign names (and even sub-folders within your downloads folder), fast-filtering or even custom, re-usable filters.\n\nDownThemAll is open-source and free. We spend a lot of time making it, and keep spending a lot of time improving it, and even fixing some problems in Firefox itself so DownThemAll! can work even better.\nWe will never add adware, spyware, user tracking or other nasty stuff. Therefore we rely on your donations exclusively to fund the development.\n\nWe are looking for people willing to help translate DownThemAll! to more languages. For a small guide on how to do that, please see our preliminary translation guide. You will get our gratitude, and the gratitude of all the users whose live you improved by bringing DownThemAll! to their language.\n\nPlease do NOT report any bugs and issues in the user review section, but file a bug report instead. This is the only way to make sure we actually see it, and it also makes communicating to us/with you a lot easier. Thanks\n\nPlease note: Version 4 of DownThemAll! is.a complete rewrite as a WebExtension, as the old add-on system was abandoned and disabled in Firefox. This was mozilla's decision, and there is nothing we can do about it. We are therefore limited to the tools the WebExtensions model provides to us, which sadly makes it impossible to provide some of the advanced features of DownThemAll! Version 3. Furthermore there are some bugs in Firefox that affect DownThemAll! as well, e.g. downloads will always succeed even if the server returns an error, but I fixed this in upcoming Firefox 71.\nHowever, we're still able to provide the advanced selection, queuing, file naming options of the old DownThemAll! and a lot more.","weeklyDownloads":220,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Nils Maier","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/105689/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224229.png?modified=1574345219","width":2400,"height":1463,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224229.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":390,"caption":"Quickly select links using advanced filters, automatically name files and folders with highly configurable masks"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224230.png?modified=1574345219","width":2274,"height":1504,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224230.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":423,"caption":"Watch your download queue progress according to your global and per-domain limits.\r\nQuickly filter and search your queue to manage to find specific downloads in your queue."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224231.png?modified=1574345219","width":506,"height":626,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224231.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":388,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"DownThemAll! comes with a button that will allow you to quickly access it's main features, but it can be configured to be a OneClick! button instead."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224232.png?modified=1574345219","width":1222,"height":1104,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224232.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":531,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Add downloads from your context menu, e.g. the link, image or video you clicked, or only from queue from the part of the website you selected."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224233.png?modified=1574345219","width":1072,"height":788,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224233.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":470,"caption":"DownThemAll! is also present in your tools menu, so you still have full access to its features even when you configured it to not show the context menu and changed the button to OneClick!"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224234.png?modified=1574345219","width":1624,"height":966,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224234.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":381,"caption":"Of course, you can manually add downloads, too."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224235.png?modified=1574345219","width":1624,"height":966,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224235.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":381,"caption":"Batch downloads are supported as well."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224236.png?modified=1574345219","width":2274,"height":1576,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224236.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":444,"caption":"DownThemAll! comes with powerful preferences that let power users make the most of the extension, but also provides sensible defaults for people who just want to download quickly."}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/NilsMaier?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.5305,"reviewCount":2593,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/reviews/","updateDate":1574777386000},{"id":"{506e023c-7f2b-40a3-8066-bc5deb40aebe}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/819/819184-32.png?modified=5b6fdd2e","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/819/819184-64.png?modified=5b6fdd2e","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/819/819184-128.png?modified=5b6fdd2e"},"name":"Gesturefy","version":"3.0.7","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3639516/gesturefy-3.0.7-fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/Robbendebiene/Gesturefy","supportURL":"https://github.com/Robbendebiene/Gesturefy/issues","description":"Navigate, operate, and browse faster with mouse gestures! A customizable mouse gesture add-on with a variety of different commands.","fullDescription":"Gesturefy is a pure mouse gesture extension, which means it's only suited for mice and not touchpads. \"What's a mouse gesture?\" you might ask yourself. Well, mouse gestures are like keyboard shortcuts, only for your mouse. Instead of pressing a bunch of keys, you simply move your mouse in a certain manner to execute commands and actions. Mouse gestures can be more natural and convenient than keyboard shortcuts and thus are also suitable for casual users. Wait, is that a mouse in your hand? Come and try it out :)\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Mouse gestures (moving the mouse while holding the left, middle, or right button)\n    More than 70 different predefined commands\n    Customizable gesture trace and status information style\n    Rocker gestures (left-click while holding the right mouse button and vice versa)\n    Wheel gestures (scroll wheel while holding the left, middle, or right button)\n    Multilingual, thanks to volunteers on Crowdin\n    User script support\n    Blacklist support\n\n\nLimitations:\n\n    Gesturefy does not work on Mozilla related pages like addons.mozilla.org, internal pages like about:addons or other add-on option pages (e.g. moz-extension://*). This is because Firefox restricts add-ons from accessing these pages for security reasons.\n    The page must be partially loaded to perform gestures.\n    MacOS Sierra: Wheel gestures currently doesn't work (see this bug)\n\n\nIf you want to support Gesturefy, please visit this page!\n\nPermissions explained:\n\n    Access your data for all websites: This is a key permission, because the complete gesture functionality is injected in every webpage you visit (which means a part of the code is running in each tab). This is necessary, because with the new API there is no other way to track your mouse movement or draw anything on the screen. It's also needed to perform page specific commands like scroll down or up.\n    Read and modify browser settings: This is required to change the context menu behaviour for MacOS and Linux users to support the usage of the right mouse button.\n    Display notifications: This is used to show a notification on Gesturefy updates or to display certain error messages.","weeklyDownloads":418,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Robbendebiene","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12947118/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/239/239512.png?modified=1594319400","width":1920,"height":963,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/239/239512.png?modified=1594319400","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":321,"caption":"Gesture: Page back"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/239/239514.png?modified=1594319400","width":1920,"height":963,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/239/239514.png?modified=1594319400","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":321,"caption":"Gesture: Reload tab"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/241/241299.png?modified=1594319406","width":1920,"height":963,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/241/241299.png?modified=1594319406","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":321,"caption":"Settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/239/239517.png?modified=1594319400","width":1920,"height":963,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/239/239517.png?modified=1594319400","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":321,"caption":"Gesture overview"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/239/239513.png?modified=1594319400","width":1920,"height":963,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/239/239513.png?modified=1594319400","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":321,"caption":"Add gesture"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/239/239516.png?modified=1594319400","width":1920,"height":963,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/239/239516.png?modified=1594319400","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":321,"caption":"Gesture overview (dark mode)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/239/239515.png?modified=1594319400","width":1920,"height":963,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/239/239515.png?modified=1594319400","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":321,"caption":"Rocker and Wheel gesture"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.3552,"reviewCount":487,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gesturefy/reviews/","updateDate":1599576697000},{"id":"simple-tab-groups@drive4ik","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/874/874813-32.png?modified=1591025921","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/874/874813-64.png?modified=1591025921","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/874/874813-128.png?modified=1591025921"},"name":"Simple Tab Groups","version":"4.5.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3565732/simple_tab_groups-4.5.1-fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/drive4ik/simple-tab-groups","supportURL":"https://github.com/drive4ik/simple-tab-groups","description":"Create, modify, and quickly change tab groups","fullDescription":"Simple Tab Groups works across browser instances/windows too.

The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.","fullDescription":"What does it do?\nFacebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension closes your Facebook tabs, deletes your Facebook cookies, and logs you out of Facebook.\nThe next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site.\n\nKnown Issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nReport Issues\nIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue here.
